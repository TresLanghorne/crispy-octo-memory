      I'm Lost, I work as a software, product engineer and designer from
      Virginia, US. I've procrastinated building this website for years but finally,
      it's here, I've carved out my own corner online. I love problem solving. I have
      always viewed programming as an artform I am looking forward to going on a journey 
      to learn more about myself and the technologies that I work with. so welcome to my Clouded Brain! 
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-400">
      By day, I'm a DevOps engineer and I love to learn and find solutions. My primary skills are C#,
      PowerShell, bicep, Azure, Git, CI/CD. I have written in a lot more but that is where my strengths
      are. I am more concerned with continually learning more than I am concerned with a specific track.
      Looking forward to more collaboration along the way.
